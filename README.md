# Fireworks
Fireworks Generator in Java using JPanel

# How it works
It creates firework simulations by creating blocks of a particular size. The blocks are linked to particle objects which are run through a simple physics simulation. When they explode, circular trajectories for all the particles are calculated and dampening is put on the velocities to give the particles a more realistic look. All the parameters are raandomized at launch and only one particle is launched at a time. The particles are put through a brightness function to make them look to "burn out"
